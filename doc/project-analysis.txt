## Introduction

21/10/22
The background to this project is a requirement from the CI course
to produce an interactive website by no later than 10/12/22, which
is 48 man days. The mooted project is to promote and provide a
summary overview of the XBasic programming language and PDE, to
dovetail the CI requirement with a group interest.

The following is the workings-out of the project design.

## Strategy / Scope

### Scheduling Limitations (budget)
As only one person (myself) is permitted to work on this project
all real days are interpreted as man days. This provides the 
limitations within which the website is to be produced.

    Planning/Analysis       6
    JS Studies              8
    Gathering Data/images   7
    Coding                  9
    Debugging/Testing       5
    README notes            4
    Margin of Error         5
    External Events         6
    TOTAL                   48

### Deliverables and UCD
    The weakest link in the schedule is in coding days (9) which 
    really only allows for two or three website pages. So this section
    considers what can be usefully delivered to the user within
    that constraint.

    The primary features of the XBasic language are the provision
    of a PDE (Program Development Environment) and an interactive
    window designer (toolbox), so these things should certainly
    appear on the main page.

    It would also be good to show debugging features on the main
    page.

    In addition, contact details should be provided on the first
    page, along with an interest group registration. These two
    things can be made somewhat JS interactive.

    The second page should provide a more detailed view of the window
    design tool. This could be done using screenshot images which can
    be stepped forward or back through by the user, thereby fulfilling
    the CI interactive requirement and providing the user with handy
    information in assessing the product.

    If these works fit well within the time frame then a third, 
    debugging demonstration page, can be developed.

    An important question to consider is whether screenshots will
    show as legible on mobile screen?
    At 350px width it is unlikely that appropriate screenshots 
    will be adequately displayed. So this project is suspended 
    for the time being.
